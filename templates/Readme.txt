Get started with KendoUIBuilder custom templates

As of version 2.0.1 you are able to define your own custom views and component templates. For convenience, we added
several examples in your installation folder. Please follow the steps below to start using them:

1. If you don't have any applications yet, create one
2. Copy the templates/ folder. By default, it is located in C:\Progress\KendoUIBuilder\templates
3. Paste it next to app/ and meta/ folders in the Generated Application

You should end up with the following file structure

my-app
    |__app
    |__meta
    |__templates

4. Open KendoUIBuilder and start editing a module. Custom views and components are immediately available
and are visually denotated with little green icon at the bottom so you can distinguish them.
